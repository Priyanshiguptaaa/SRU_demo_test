## Introduction
SRU implement in pytorch（Training RNNs as Fast as CNNs） [https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02755](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02755)  

SRU summary is here([Simple Recurrent Unit(SRU](https://bamtercelboo.github.io/2017/10/19/SRU-Summary/))).

## Requirement
* python 3
* pytorch > 0.1
* torchtext > 0.1（if version 0.2.0 is failed, try the 0.1.0）
* numpy

## How to use the folder or file

- the file of **hyperparams.py** contains all hyperparams that need to modify, based on yours nedds, select neural networks what you want and config the hyperparams.

- the file of **main-hyperparams.py** is the main function,run the command ("python main_hyperparams.py") to execute the demo.

- the file of **main-hyperparams-CV.py** is the main function for CV data like MR/CR.

- the folder of **models** contains all neural networks models.

- the file of **train_ALL_CNN.py** is the train function about CNN

- the file of **train_ALL_LSTM.py** is the train function about LSTM

- the file of **train_ALL_SRU.py** is the train function about SRU

- the folder of **loaddata** contains some file of load dataset

- the folder of **word2vec** is the file of word embedding that you want to use

- the folder of **data** contains the dataset file,contains train data,dev data,test data.

- the folder of **Temp_Test_Result** save the temp result for cv function.

- the file of **temp_train.txt** is being used to save tarin data fot cv.

- the file of **temp_test.txt.txt** is being used to save test data fot cv..

- the file of **Parameters.txt** is being used to save all parameters values.

- the file of **Test_Result.txt** is being used to save the result of test,in the demo,save a model and test a model immediately,and int the end of training, will calculate the best result value.

## How to use the Word Embedding in demo? 

- the word embedding file saved in the folder of **word2vec**, but now is empty, because of it is to big,so if you want to use word embedding,you can to download word2vec or glove file, then saved in the folder of word2vec,and make the option of word_Embedding to True and modifiy the value of word_Embedding_Path in the **hyperparams.py** file.


## SRU  Networks

1. **model_BiLSTM_1.py** is a simple bidirection LSTM neural networks model.

2. **model_CNN.py** is a simple CNN neural networks model.

3. **model_SRU.py**  and  **model_BiSRU.py**  is a simple  SRU  neural networks model that use the source code of **cuda_functional.py**(the SRU author code, [https://github.com/taolei87/sru](https://github.com/taolei87/sru)).

4. **model_SRU_Formula.py** is a simple SRU neural networks model that use the SRU formula.


## How to config hyperparams in the file of hyperparams.py
